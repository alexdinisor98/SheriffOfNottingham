Sheriff of Nottingham 

A minimalist version of the game, using basic concepts of OOP such as aggregation, 
inheritance, overriding and overloading, respecting the SOLID principles.

I searched the assets in hand, so as  to declare the type of assets in the bag 
and I added an illegal asset in the bag depending on each type of the player 

I created for each type of player a method used for the player when he is a sheriff
to inspect the bags of the other players / to accept their bribe / to allow 
putting the declared assets on the merchant stand.

At the end of the rounds, the bonus assets particular to each illegal asset. I
used LinkedHashMap to compute the asset frequency.

The output is the final score of every player descendincally.
